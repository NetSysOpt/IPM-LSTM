# IPM-LSTM: A Learning-Based Interior Point Method for Solving Nonlinear Programs
This repo is an implementation of the NeurIPS 2024 paper: IPM-LSTM: A Learning-Based Interior Point Method for Solving Nonlinear Programs.
## Introduction
We focus on solving the following NLP:
$$
\underset{y \in \mathbb{R}^m}{\text{min}} \; f(y) := \frac{1}{2}|| J^ky+F^k ||^2.
$$
